# Obituary.js

CLI tool for generating obituaries, written in JS

## Purpose

A learning exercise for me to create a CLI tool with Node.js.

A place to not be morbid about death. [Read my thoughts about obituaries.](http://tinyletter.com/jeremywong/letters/on-obituaries)

## API

```bash
# run the "obit" command to begin the prompt of questions.
obit
```
