# Obituary.js

CLI tool for generating obituaries, written in JS

## Purpose

A learning exercise for me to create a CLI tool with Node.js.

A place to not be morbid about death. [Read my thoughts about obituaries.](http://tinyletter.com/jeremywong/letters/on-obituaries)

After reading a bunch of NYTimes Obituaries, I've noticed they all have the same format.

1. Opening hook of how this person made an impact
1. A famous moment of the recently deceased (or perhaps two or three)
1. Family history - abruptly go back to talking about the very beginning
1. A short chronology of big moments in the deceased life
1. Family Acknowledgements - "He/She is survived by..."
1. Closing words from the deceased, perhaps a quote

## API

```bash
# run the "obit" command to begin the prompt of questions.
obit
```
